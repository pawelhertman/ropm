 - bug that was using the unsanitized npm alias instead of the ropm package name in certain install situations for direct dependencies.



## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-24
[0.4.0]:   https://github.com/rokucommunity/ropm/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0
### Added
 - `ropm.noprefix` package.json option to prevent certain modules from having a prefix applied.
 - reject installing packages that have the `ropm.noprefix` setting present in `package.json`: this setting is only for use in client applications.
### Fixed

## [0.3.0] - 2020-09-23
[0.3.0]: https://github.com/rokucommunity/ropm/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0

### Changed
 - do not copy `roku_module` folders from ropm modules during `ropm install`
### Fixed
 - bug where npm would throw `npm ERR! extraneous` errors when installing file protocol packages, causing the install to bomb. Now we just ignore that error because it's not important.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/rokucommunity/ropm/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0

### Added
 -  "clean" command which removes all ropm files from a project (but leaves the package.json intact)
### Changed
 - remove unnecessary files from published `ropm` npm package
 - the `"ropm"` keyword is now required in ropm module's package.json, and any package without it will be ignored by ropm
### Fixed
 - missing shebang at top of cli script causing problems running ropm from the terminal
 - fix running `ropm install` without any arguments



## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-05
